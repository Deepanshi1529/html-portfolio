<h1>The Best Movies According to ME (Deepanshi) </h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

 <hr>

 <h3>3 idiots</h3>
 <p>A very amazing movie revolving around the life of 3 engineers, depticting their struggles, all three of them had their different desires or aspirations form life.</p>

 <h3>Bulbul</h3>
 <p>Not a tyypical horror movie but somewhat a demonic-cult one with a very strong message for the society.</p>

 <h3>Laila Majnu</h3>
 <p>Movie that i saw 2 times till now, and everytime it had me cry my balls out. It's about loveee with a lot of heartbreak. Really loved this movie and highly recommended to the people who runs from love.</p>
